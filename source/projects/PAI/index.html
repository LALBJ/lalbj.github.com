            <div class="content has-text-justified">
              <p>
                Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) align image features to the
                input of Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing multi-modal
                reasoning and knowledge utilization capabilities. However, the
                disparity in scale between models of different modalities has
                resulted in LLMs assuming a predominant role in multimodal
                comprehension. This imbalance in model integration can lead to
                instances of hallucinatory outputs.
                <span class="soft-highlight">
                  In particular, LVLMs may generate descriptions that persist in
                  the absence of visual input, suggesting that these narratives
                  are disproportionately influenced by the textual context. We
                  refer to this phenomenon as ``text inertia.''
                </span>
                To counteract this issue, we introduce
                <span class="soft-highlight">a training-free algorithm</span>
                designed to find an equilibrium between image comprehension and
                language inference. Specifically, we
                <span class="soft-highlight"
                  >involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights
                  assigned to image tokens</span
                >, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.
                Meanwhile, we
                <span class="soft-highlight"
                  >the logits of multimodal inputs from the model logits of pure
                  text input</span
                >, which can let model not biased towards only LLM. By enhancing
                images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can
                let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text
                inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs. Our extensive
                experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the
                frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of
                different metrics.
