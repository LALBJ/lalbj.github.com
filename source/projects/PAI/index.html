            <p>
              Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) align image features to the
              input of Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing multi-modal
              reasoning and knowledge utilization capabilities. However, the
              disparity in scale between models of different modalities has
              resulted in LLMs assuming a predominant role in multimodal
              comprehension. This imbalance in model integration can lead to
              instances of hallucinatory outputs.
              <span class="soft-highlight">
                In particular, LVLMs may generate descriptions that persist in
                the absence of visual input, suggesting that these narratives
                are disproportionately influenced by the textual context. We
                refer to this phenomenon as ``text inertia.''
              </span>
              To counteract this issue, we introduce
              <span class="soft-highlight">a training-free algorithm</span>
              designed to find an equilibrium between image comprehension and
              language inference. Specifically, we
              <span class="soft-highlight">involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights
                assigned to image tokens</span>, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.
              Meanwhile, we
              <span class="soft-highlight">the logits of multimodal inputs from the model logits of pure
                text input</span>, which can let model not biased towards only LLM. By enhancing
              images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can
              let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text
              inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs. Our extensive
              experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the
              frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of
              different metrics.
