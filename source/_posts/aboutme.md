Shi Liu is currently a M.S. student of Software Engineering at the [Visual Analytics and Intelligence Group of ZJU (ZJUVAI)](https://zjuvag.org/), under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/). I also worked with Researcher [Kecheng Zheng](https://zkcys001.github.io/) from Ant Research. My research focuses on multi-modal learning and deep learning, particularly on large vision-language models. I began my journey in deep learning from June 2022. Prior to that, I was focused on software development technologies.

From Feb. 2022 to Jun. 2022, I was a software development intern at Ant Group.

From Feb. 2023 to Jun. 2023, I was a research intern at OPPO.

From Jun. 2023 to Oct. 2023, I worked in Zhejiang Lab as a research intern, under the supervision of Lechao Cheng.

**I am currently seeking PhD positions, Research Assistant roles, and full-time researcher positions. If you are interested, please feel free to reach out to me via email at zju_ls@zju.edu.cn.**
